# Task 1 - Overview
The **Internet of Things (IoT)** is a term that describes the network of physical objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity to exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet. The IoT has various applications and benefits, such as improving efficiency, convenience, safety, and sustainability. 

The history of IoT can be traced back to the early 1990s, when the first Internet-connected device was created: a toaster that could be turned on and off remotely via the Internet. Since then, the IoT has evolved rapidly with the advancement of wireless technologies, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics.

One of the challenges of IoT is to define a common model and architecture that can support the interoperability and scalability of diverse IoT devices and services. Several IoT reference models have been proposed by different organizations and initiatives, such as the **IoT-Architectural Reference Model (IoT-ARM)** by the European Union, the **IoT Reference Model** by SpringerLink, and the **IoT Reference Architecture** by IEEE. These models provide a common vocabulary and framework for describing the main components and functions of IoT systems, such as devices, gateways, networks, platforms, services, and applications.

The needs of IoT vary depending on the domain and context of application. Some of the common needs are:
|No.| Needs                  | Description                                                                                                       |
|--|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|1.| **Data collection**    | Collecting data from their environment using sensors or other methods.                                            |
|2.| **Data processing**    | Processing the collected data locally or remotely using algorithms or models.                                     |
|3.| **Data communication** | Communicating the processed data to other devices or systems using wired or wireless networks.                    |
|4.| **Data storage**       | Storing the data locally or remotely using databases or cloud services.                                           |
|5.| **Data analysis**      | Analyzing the data using techniques such as statistics, machine learning, or artificial intelligence.             |
|6.| **Data visualization** | Presenting the data in a meaningful way using graphs, charts, or dashboards.                                      |
|7.| **Data security**      | Protecting the data from unauthorized access or modification using encryption, authentication, or authorization.  |

An example of IoT implementation is smart agriculture, which uses IoT devices and services to monitor and control various aspects of crop production, such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, irrigation, fertilization, pest control, and harvesting. Smart agriculture can improve crop yield, quality, and profitability by optimizing resource use, reducing waste, and enhancing decision making.
